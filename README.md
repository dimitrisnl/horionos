Trying out Phoenix & Liview by creating a dashboard.

As it stands, I have implemented the following:

- User authentication
- Simplified multi-tenant arch with row-level security.
- Memberships with roles
- Listing and clearing sessions
- Workers for background processing
- Locking accounts
- Slack notifications
- Rate limiting
